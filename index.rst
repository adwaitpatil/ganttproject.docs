Assorted bits of GanttProject docs
========================================

These pages provide documentation for some of GanttProject's features. This is by no means
a comprehensive manual and is not planned to be. GanttProject application is simple and friendly
enough to be used without any manuals. However, there are some non-trivial points and rough corners
which are documented here.

You may also want to checkout `Frequently Asked Questions <http://ganttproject.blogspot.com/search/label/faq>`_ which
are published on our blog pages.
